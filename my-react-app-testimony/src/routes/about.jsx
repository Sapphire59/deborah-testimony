                The beginning of when the eczema started
              </h3>
              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                When I was 8 years old I started to get a little eczema on the
                inside of my arm and the back on my knee.it was a itchy so my
                mother put some ointment and lotion to help, it would control
                the itchiness for a while, but then it would return. By the time
                I was 10 there was patches of dry skin on different areas of my
                body. My Grandparents came to visit us from India, and when they
                returned I went with them.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                My Grandparents first took me to a Homeopathic Doctor, I tried
                the medicine he gave me for a while but it didn't help so I
                stopped taking it. Then they took me to an Ayurvedic Doctor and
                prescribed a red oil, a soap, and an ointment to put topically.
                Also I had to ingest about 5 different medicines and medicinal
                Ghee every day. After about a month I started to get better my
                appetite improved and I gained more weight. I continued this
                treatment for almost 4 months and it seemed my body was healed
                so I returned home to Texas.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                I thought I could stop the Ayurvedic medicine because externally
                I looked healthy and my skin was clear. Then 1 day all of sudden
                my body did a 180 change. My skin became dry and itchy, when I
                scratched it would bleed, my face and neck became dry and chalky
                looking. The eczema covered me from my face to my feet. My skin
                became discolored and dark and it was so painful. My skin was so
                sensitive I could only wear cotton clothes everything else hurt.
                Even when water touched my skin I would scream in pain.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                At this time our first response was to take me to the
                Dermatologist to see if she could help me. She prescribed
                cortizone that I was supposed to put on my body after my bath.
                Then I was told to wrap my arms and legs with plasic wrap. But
                according to her I was the worst case she had ever see, and I
                had no hope of ever getting better. This treatment was so
                painful every time water touched my skin it felt like burning
                pain. So we tried it for while, but then my body got worse.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                So this time my mother took me to see a Naturopathic Doctor who
                took some tests and gave me advice on how to get better. I
                stopped using the medicine, and started taking acidophilus with
                bifidus yogurt. I removed all sugar, carbs and had a little
                fruit in my diet. I am so thankful for this Doctor because he
                was a Believer in Jesus, he prayed with and encouraged my mom.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                After a while my body started to show symptoms resulting in full
                body pain, and intense migraine headaches, I couldn't sleep, and
                didn't leave the house. Then one day my mom said you are going
                to take the Word of God as your medicine, every day I focused on
                the love of God for me, that He is my Good Father, that He cares
                for me and wants me well. It took me about a year but the pain
                and the headaches in my body stopped, and my skin started to get
                better, water was no longer painful for me. The Healing power of
                Jesus had started its work in me.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                As I got older I would listen to Word-filled teaching myself and
                I started to grow in Faith. I studied the Word, meditated and
                memorized scripture and learned so much about what God desires
                for me, Healing is for me and is my right as a child of God. As
                I got into my teenage years through the power of God's Word and
                speaking in unknown Tongues, and using natural products, every
                year my skin and body was getting better. During this time I was
                also volunteering with children in various areas from 16-25
                years old, I am so thankful I got this chance to minister to
                children, pray with them, listen and share the love of Jesus
                with them. It was an important time for me, I started to love
                and care for others I was no longer focused on myself and the
                pain that I was fighting. Healing started to manifest in my body
                as Jesus changed my heart.

              <p class="border-1 bg-white rounded-md shadow-2xl m-2 p-2">
                The eczema in my body was almost gone, but I had one more fight
                to overcome. One day I started to have breathing problems, the
                first time it happened I couldn't speak or catch my breath. I
                did stay overnight at the urgent care the doctor said my
                bronchial tubes were clogged up so I took the medicine and then
                I was fine. But the second time it happened I decided to fight
                and received my healing, It was hard, and exhausting because
                every breath was a struggle, I spoke to my body the Word and
                commaded my body to be healed through the night I listened to
                Keith Moore's album "Healing in His Wings" and after a couple
                days I was all better. For the next few years every time I had
                diffulcy breathing I would speak over my body the healing
                scriptures and command my body to be healed and after a while I
                would be fine. But thank God I only had problems breathing 1
                time about 4 1/2 years ago and after that day, I never had any
                problems breathing.
                <br />
                Thank you Jesus I am now healed, my skin is no longer sensitive,
                dry or itchy, I have completely returned to the normal weight of
                a lady my age. I also believe He has renewed my youth because I
                don't look my age.
